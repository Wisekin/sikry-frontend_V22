 тип [Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {label, dataSources, industry, allIndustries, softwareDev, marketing, fintech, location, enterLocation, companySize, allSizes, employees, minConfidence, anyScore, clear}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.] {

I see the error - it's related to how the translation is being used in the code. The error occurs because the translation key `search.filters` is returning an object instead of a string. Looking at the translations file, I can see that `search.filters` is indeed an object containing multiple filter-related translations.

Let me help you fix this. You should use the specific label key from the filters object instead of the entire filters object. Here's how to fix it:

```tsx
<Button variant="outline" size="sm">
  <Filter className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  {t("search.filters.label")}
</Button>
```

The change is to use `search.filters.label` instead of just `search.filters`. This will return the string "Filters" in English or "Filtres" in French, rather than trying to render the entire filters object.

This error occurred because the translation system was trying to render an object (the entire filters configuration) as a React child, which isn't valid. By accessing the specific `label` property, we get the string value we actually want to display.

I'll help you fix the code. First, I need to locate the file where this code exists. Let me search for it.
