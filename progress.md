# Natural Language Search Feature Implementation Progress

## ü§ñ Agent Rules
IMPORTANT: These rules must never be deleted and must be referenced before any action:
1. Always verify file existence before creation using appropriate tools
2. Update this progress file after EVERY significant change:
   - Move completed items to "Completed ‚úÖ" section
   - Add new tasks to "Next Steps üìù" section
   - Update "In Progress üöß" with current tasks
3. Each update must maintain clear tracking of:
   - What was just completed
   - What is currently being worked on
   - What should be done next
4. Never remove completed items - they serve as implementation history

## Overview
Implementing a natural language search system with:
- OpenAI query parsing
- Supabase caching
- Free public data sources
- Rate limiting

## Completed ‚úÖ
- Initial project planning and architecture design.
- Documentation review.
- Database setup:
  - Created migration script (`013-search-rate-limit.sql`) for API cache table, rate limiting table, enhanced search history table, and helper functions.
  - Created migration script (`014-add-metadata-to-api-cache.sql`) to add `metadata` column to `api_cache` table.
  - Verified missing tables from main schema.
  - Added proper database indexes and RLS policies.
  - Initial cache table structure and validation.
  - Cleanup functions for maintenance.
- Core utilities:
  - OpenAI configuration (`lib/config/openai.ts`).
  - Query parser implementation (`lib/utils/query-parser.ts`).
  - Cache utility functions (`lib/utils/cache.ts` and `lib/utils/cache/searchCache.ts`).
- Search API implementation (`app/api/search/natural/route.ts`):
  - Initial natural language parsing, cache integration, Supabase querying, error handling, and response formatting.
  - Corrected `searchExternalSources` function call to use only the `query` argument.
  - Fixed `highlights` array generation to conform to `Array<{ field: string; text: string; }>` type and restored overall function structure.
- Rate Limiter (`lib/utils/cache/rateLimiter.ts`):
  - Corrected `createClient` import to use server-side Supabase client.
  - Fixed `organizations.plan` access to correctly retrieve plan information.
- Search Suggestions API (`app/api/search/suggestions/route.ts` & `utils/supabase/server.ts`):
  - Made `createClient` in `utils/supabase/server.ts` synchronous to resolve `supabase.from is not a function` error.
- Integrated external data sources: Business registries, Wikidata, OpenCorporates API.
- Implemented (initial) rate limiting middleware.
- Updated frontend search component with data source selection.
- Added (initial) API response caching system.
- Enhanced error handling and loading states in UI.

## In Progress üöß
- **Testing & Validation**:
  - Devising and executing a comprehensive test plan for the caching system:
    - Verifying search results are correctly cached (including `metadata`).
    - Ensuring cache entries are invalidated based on TTL.
    - Confirming cache hits and misses are logged/handled as expected by `searchCache.ts`.
  - Testing rate limiting functionality under different scenarios (e.g., different organization plans).
- **Refinement & Enhancement**:
  - Fine-tuning cache performance (e.g., TTL values, cache eviction strategies) based on testing.
  - Improving search metrics logging in the `search_history` table (e.g., filters, more metadata, accurate execution time and result counts).
  - Finalizing the integration and interaction of `searchCache.ts` utilities and `DbRateLimiter` within the search API and potentially other relevant endpoints.

## Next Steps üìù
1.  **CRITICAL: Run database migration scripts `013-search-rate-limit.sql` (for initial tables) AND `014-add-metadata-to-api-cache.sql` (for `metadata` column)** to set up `api_cache`, `rate_limits`, and `search_history` tables correctly.
2.  Execute the test plan for the caching system (see "In Progress").
3.  Execute tests for the rate limiting system.
4.  Write unit and integration tests for:
    - `performSearch` function (if applicable, or core search logic within API route).
    - Caching utilities (`searchCache.ts`).
    - Rate limiting utilities (`rateLimiter.ts`).
    - Key API endpoints.
    - Cover edge cases and error scenarios.
5.  Update project documentation:
    - Add details about the refined caching and rate limiting systems.
    - Provide examples of API usage and expected responses.
    - Document environment variables needed for external APIs and other configurations.

## Current Focus
1. Ensuring the database schema is up-to-date for caching (`metadata` column).
2. Systematically testing the end-to-end caching and rate limiting functionality.
3. Monitoring and optimizing cache hit rates and search performance metrics post-fixes.

## Technical Debt/Improvements (Future Considerations)
- Implement more sophisticated query result scoring/ranking.
- Add backup data sources for reliability.
- Implement a more granular rate limiting quota system (e.g., per feature within a plan).
- Add automated testing for external data source integrations.
- Add analytics for search patterns and user behavior.
- Consider implementing query suggestions based on popular/past searches.

## Technical Stack
- Next.js
- Supabase
- OpenAI API
- Various Public APIs (Wikidata, OpenCorporates, Business Registries)
