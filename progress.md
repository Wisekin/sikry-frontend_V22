# Natural Language Search Feature Implementation Progress

## ü§ñ Agent Rules
IMPORTANT: These rules must never be deleted and must be referenced before any action:
1. Always verify file existence before creation using appropriate tools
2. Update this progress file after EVERY significant change:
   - Move completed items to "Completed ‚úÖ" section
   - Add new tasks to "Next Steps üìù" section
   - Update "In Progress üöß" with current tasks
3. Each update must maintain clear tracking of:
   - What was just completed
   - What is currently being worked on
   - What should be done next
4. Never remove completed items - they serve as implementation history

## Overview
Implementing a natural language search system with:
- OpenAI query parsing
- Supabase caching
- Free public data sources
- Rate limiting

## Current Status: Getting Started

### Completed ‚úÖ
- Initial project planning and architecture design
- Documentation review
- Database setup:
  - Cache table structure and validation
  - RLS policies for security
  - Cleanup functions for maintenance
- Core utilities:
  - OpenAI configuration (`lib/config/openai.ts`)
  - Query parser implementation (`lib/utils/query-parser.ts`)
  - Cache utility functions (`lib/utils/cache.ts`)
- Search API implementation:
  - Natural language parsing
  - Cache integration
  - Supabase database querying
  - Error handling and response formatting

### In Progress üöß
- Testing integrated data sources functionality
- Fine-tuning cache performance
- Implementing database schema updates
- Enhancing the search API:
  - Implementing rate limiting based on organization plans.
  - Adding caching functionality using the `api_cache` table.
  - Logging search metrics in the `search_history` table.
- Testing and debugging the `performSearch` function:
  - Ensure proper handling of different search scopes (`companies`, `contacts`, etc.).
  - Verify error handling and response formatting.
- Finalizing the integration of `CacheManager` and `RateLimiter` in the search API.

### Just Completed ‚úÖ
- Created new migration script (013-search-rate-limit.sql) for:
  - API cache table
  - Rate limiting table
  - Enhanced search history table
  - Helper functions for cache and rate limit management
- Verified missing tables from main schema
- Added proper database indexes and RLS policies

### Previously Completed ‚úÖ
1. Implemented rate limiting middleware
2. Updated frontend search component with data source selection
3. Added API response caching system
4. Integrated external data sources:
   - Business registries
   - Wikidata
   - OpenCorporates API
5. Enhanced error handling and loading states

### Next Steps üìù
1. Test the caching system:
   - Verify that search results are correctly cached and invalidated based on TTL.
   - Ensure cache hits are logged properly.
2. Optimize the rate limiter:
   - Add support for dynamic rate limits based on organization plans.
   - Test rate limiting functionality under different scenarios.
3. Improve search metrics logging:
   - Add filters and metadata to the `search_history` table.
   - Ensure accurate logging of execution time and result counts.
4. Write unit tests for the `performSearch` function and middleware:
   - Cover edge cases and error scenarios.
   - Validate integration with Supabase and caching utilities.
5. Update documentation:
   - Add details about the caching and rate limiting systems.
   - Provide examples of API usage and expected responses.

### Current Focus
1. Monitoring and optimizing cache hit rates
2. Testing external data source reliability
3. Analyzing search performance metrics

### Technical Debt/Improvements
1. Implement more sophisticated query result scoring/ranking
2. Add backup data sources for reliability
3. Implement rate limiting quota system based on user tiers
4. Add automated testing for external data source integrations
3. Add analytics for search patterns
4. Consider implementing query suggestions

### Technical Stack
- Next.js (existing)
- Supabase (existing)
- OpenAI API (to be integrated)
- Public APIs (to be selected and integrated)

### Immediate Next Action
Review and implement the cache table structure in `scripts/012-api-cache.sql` to start building our foundation.
